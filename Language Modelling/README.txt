Language modelling:

1. Build an n gram language model based on nltk’s Reuters corpus (from
nltk.corpus import reuters), provide the code. (You can build a language
model in a few lines of code using the NLTK package, you can use bigram,
trigram or higher order grams).

2. After step 1, make simple predictions with the language model you
have built in question 1. We will start with two simple words – “he is”. Let
your n gram model predict the next word, show both
code and module generated results.

3. Based on the work of question 1 and question 2, generate a few
sentences starting with “he is”.
